# Week 1

This was the first session. This week, we did a teambuilding task and then got ourselves into teams.

We then read through the specification together and looked at the specific Key features from the specification and thought about which ones we would like to be able to implement first (what is most important).

Here, we decided that we would aim to complete all of the goals as out team contains six people.

We then got ourselves a shared folder set up on one-drive so that we could access the same documents, and began working on some questions for the meeting next week wit John McNamara (From IBM)
