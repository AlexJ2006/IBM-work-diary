# Week 2

This week, we began the session by reviewing the questions that we had come up with last week adn adding some new questions to the list. 

We eventually came up with our final set of questions. 

Later, we spoke to John McNamara from IBM in a teams meeting. During this time, we asked questions and made notes based on what John told us. 

We then began working on the specification document as a group (within the shared space), now that we had a better understadning of the requirements of the project.

We filled out the important basic information for the group and began working on the MoSCoW for the system's non-functional requirements 'with the User Stories.

We also entered the Project overview and Product goal for the project.

We set up a GitHub repository for the group project. Which we will use as a replacement for Jira as it allows us to organise our sprints within a dashboard (extremely similar to Jira).

I then downloaded my Virtual Machine and ensured I could run the base program properly.
